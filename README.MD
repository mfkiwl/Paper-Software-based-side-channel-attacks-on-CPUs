Title: Soware based side-channel aacks on CPUs - Their history and how we behaved

Abstract: This paper focuses on presenting the chronological order of soft-
ware based side-channel attacks on processors. This is achieved
by introducing key attacks since 2003 in the chronological order,
explaining how these attacks work and how they were fixed or
worked around. Additionally, a small part of this paper focuses on
the behaviour of computer scientists and computer users after the
publication of such attacks. Why did we wait until the catastrophe
happened?
